# Git Workflow for Pair Programming

Rather than using `git commit -m`, you should get into the practice of running `git commit` instead. Then, you can write in a `Co-authored-by: FirstName LastName <email@address.com>` line at the end of each commit message so both pairing partners are credited for your work!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you forget to add a co-author, it's not the end of the world. You should just press on ahead to your next commit, but try to remember to attribute your co-author next time!
{% endhint %}

Make sure to push your commit\(s\) to both of the pairs' forks after [you add each other as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

The next time you come back from a break, consider switching whose Live Share session you're using. Don't forget that your pair will need to pull down the latest changes every time you switch off.
