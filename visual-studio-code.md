# Visual Studio Code

We'll be using Visual Studio Code as our primary text editor of choice.

## Configuration

### Settings

```javascript
{
  "editor.renderWhitespace": "all",
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",
  "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
}
```

### Install

* Live Share

### Disable

* Source Control from left Activity Bar sidebar

![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Banned 

* Prettier
* Quokka
* Using Git from within the Visual Studio Code GUI is prohibited. You may use Git functionality only from within the terminal \(if you're using the integrated terminal, that's fine!\)

## Pair Programming

Rather than using `git commit -m`, you will use `git commit` and write in a `Co-authored-by: FirstName LastName <email@address.com>` line at the end of each commit message.

You will then push your commit to both of the pairs' forks!

The next time you come back from break, switch whose Live Share session you're using. Make sure you pull down the latest changes every time!
