# Linux Dual Boot

Congratulations! You've figured out the time intensive process of installing your dual boot setup. Now it's time to enjoy the fruits of your labor!

Once you boot into Linux, unlike the Windows Subsystem for Linux and Linux Virtual Machine options, you don't have to keep track of answers to questions like "Is this a Windows thing? Or is this a Linux thing?" since you're exclusively within the Linux ecosystem.

Two minor things you may want to be on the look out for are:

1. Your webcam might not play nicely with Linux. If this is the case, always have a secondary device \(eg, mobile device\) handy for video calls.
2. Make sure you configure Git with your [name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/) and the [email address you use for GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)!

Otherwise, welcome to Linux, and enjoy your stay!
